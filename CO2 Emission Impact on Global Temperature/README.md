# CO2 Emission Impact on Global Temperature
CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas, responsible for about two-thirds of the total warming influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases. The accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gases from transportation, such as methane (CH4) and nitric oxide (N2O), causes the Earth's atmosphere to become warmer, resulting in climate change and an increase in the Earth's surface temperature globally.

Therefore, it is important to address this issue with a scalable and transparent approach. Through the use of an application that can calculate and measure carbon emissions generated from individual transportation, it is expected to better understand the impact of each person's contribution to climate change.

## About Data
[**Dependent Variable : CO2 contribution to global mean surface**](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/contribution-to-temp-rise-by-gas)

CO2 emissions come from various human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The contribution of CO2 emissions to global mean surface temperature greatly affects climate change and global warming.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the transportation sector refer to the amount of greenhouse gases produced by different modes of transportation during activities. A commonly used unit for measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the transportation sector is the “Gt” or gigaton, which is equivalent to one billion metric tons.
Factors contributing to CO2 emissions from the transportation sector involve various modes of transportation:

| **Passenger Road Vehicles** | Passenger road vehicles include vehicles such as passenger cars, buses, and other public transportation vehicles designed to carry passengers on roads. |
| **Aviation**                | Aviation involves aircraft used for the transportation of passengers or cargo by air. Includes commercial aircraft, private aircraft, and cargo aircraft. |
| **Road Freight Vehicles**   | Road freight vehicles refer to vehicles designed to transport cargo and goods over highways. Examples include freight trucks, heavy goods trucks, and other commercial vehicles. |
| **Rail**                    | Rail refers to rail transportation systems that use rails to transport passengers and cargo. Includes passenger trains, freight trains, and other trains. |
| **Shipping**                | Shipping relates to transportation by sea using ships or ocean-going vessels. Involves the transportation of cargo and passengers at sea, and can include freighters, passenger ferries, and cruise ships. |
| **Other**                   | A category that includes other transportation sectors not specifically covered in the above categories. Includes modes of transportation such as pipeline transportation, inter-island transportation, or other innovative transportation methods. |
